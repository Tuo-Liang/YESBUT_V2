# When ‘YES’ Meets ‘BUT’: Can AI Comprehend Contradictory Humor in Comics?



### [[Paper](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2024/oral/97967)] [[Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.19088)] [[Webpage](https://vulab-ai.github.io/YESBUT_Homepage/)] [[Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/zhehuderek/YESBUT_Benchmark)]



## Our Goals

We aim to challenge AI systems in their ability to recognize and interpret visual humor, grasp nuances in human behavior, comprehend wordplay, and appreciate cultural references. This understanding can enhance AI's ability to interact with users, generate creative content, and interpret multimedia content more effectively, thereby improving user experience in various applications such as content recommendation systems, virtual assistants, and automated content creation tools.

We collect and annotate images which convey various forms of visual humor and storytelling through simple comic panels. They explore themes such as human behavior, animal antics, and wordplay, often leading to unexpected or ironic conclusions.

## Dataset

### Download
- Annotation File: The annotated data is available [here: data/YesBut_data.json](https://github.com/Tuo-Liang/YESBUT/blob/main/data/YesBut_data.json).

- Image Download: Download the associated images by running the following command:
```
python download_images.py --json_file='data/YesBut_data.json' --save_folder='data/YesBut_images'
```
This will save the images to the specified `data/YesBut_images` folder.


### Annotated data format
- The file is in `/data/YesBut_data.json`
- The file has the format such as following.
```

        "description": "The comic is divided into two panels, each presenting a contradictory perspective of the same object\u2014a mug. In the first panel, the mug is illustrated as an adorable fox with closed eyes, giving off a serene and cute vibe. It's an object that one would admire or find endearing. However, in the second panel, we see a person drinking from this fox-shaped mug. The contradiction lies in the mug's impracticality: its ears and head protrude awkwardly, obstructing the person's ability to sip comfortably. Despite its endearing appearance, the mug fails its primary function as a practical vessel for beverages.",

## Evaluation
Modify the "predict_model_name.sh".
```
#Task claude3 as an example
data="annotated_data/data_annotation.json"
image_folder="YESBUT_cropped_yesbut"
write_path_surffix=".json"
#task options: contradiction | moral_mcq | title_mcq

use_caption=False

task="contradiction"
echo "==============================="
echo "claude3 eval"
echo "==============================="
python3 -u predict_claude_opus.py \
    --read_path ${data} \
    --write_path "results/results_claude3_"${task}"_"${write_path_surffix} \
    --task ${task} \
    --use_caption ${use_caption} \
    --image_folder ${image_folder}

```

Then run the command:
```
bash predict_model_name.sh
```
